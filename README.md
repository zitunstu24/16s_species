# General Description
This project is for assigning taxonmy classes to 16s rRNA sequences

# preprocessing

1. Data quality was checked with fastqc (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
2. mapping was done with blastn (all against all) 
3. Further proccessing (e.g species names) in R
4. processed data will be found in inputs folder


# quick start
1. git clone https://github.com/zitunstu24/16s_species
2. cd 16s_species
3. Rscript heatmap.R 
4. find the results in outputs folder

Processing codes will be updated soon
